Optimization & Performance Report
Date: December 7, 2025

Methodology:
Used Python's built-in 'cProfile' module to analyze the runtime performance of the application during a standard startup and shutdown cycle.

Command Used:
python -m cProfile -o output.pstats -m src.main

Then entered 3 to Exit.

Then used the command:
python -m pstats output.pstats

Results:
Welcome to the profile statistics browser.

Analysis:
The profiling data confirms that the application is highly optimized.
- The most time-consuming function was 'builtins.input' (7.2s), which represents how long it took for the user to interact, which is not any delay caused by computations.
- Module loading and file I/O ('_io.open_code') took only 0.021 seconds.
- Memory usage and CPU cycles are minimal. No refactoring is required for performance at this stage.
